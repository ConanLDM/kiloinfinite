# README
This application has an emphasis on weight (hence the word kilo), however, I am not looking to make it the sole focus of the application.

Weight has been recently implemented into the Kilo model and Kilo records.

New Infinite model is based around model fields of count and price.

### The below has been achieved
For now, the application intends to use Sidekiq and Hotwire(focus is Turbo not Stimulus with this application) as two of its main technologies.

Infinite MVC setup together with seeds setup to generate Infinite records.

Bootstrap flavoured Popover, Modal and a Popover inside a Modal.

#### Arriving Soon
Expansion of assets including images and videos, likely users will be able to upload these via Active Storage.

Inclusion of deletion CRUD action in both Kilo and Infinite sectionss of the application.

Further models and controllers, as not looking to create extensively comprehensive versions of them.

Vast extension of content in the application.

Addition of further seeds.
